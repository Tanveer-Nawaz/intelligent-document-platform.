# Intelligent Document Understanding & Summarization Platform

An enterprise-grade NLP platform for understanding, summarizing, and querying long-form documents.

## 🚀 Overview
This project is an end-to-end Intelligent Document Understanding system that ingests long documents (PDF/DOC), preserves semantic structure, extracts actionable insights, and enables natural-language querying across stored documents.

Unlike basic summarization tools, this platform is designed to handle long-context documents while maintaining semantic continuity and producing structured, decision-ready outputs.

## ✨ Key Features
- 📄 PDF & DOC document ingestion
- 🧠 Semantic segmentation and long-context chunking
- 📝 Multi-level summarization:
  - Executive summary
  - Detailed summary
  - Section-wise summaries
- 🔍 Structured insight extraction:
  - Decisions
  - Deadlines
  - Risks
  - Recommendations
- 🔎 Semantic search and natural-language querying
- 🏗️ Modular, scalable architecture

## 🧩 System Architecture
The system is composed of independent, scalable components:
- Document ingestion and parsing
- NLP processing pipeline
- Summarization and insight extraction engines
- Embedding-based semantic search
- REST API layer for interaction

The design is model-agnostic and avoids hard-coded dependencies, making it future-proof and extensible.
